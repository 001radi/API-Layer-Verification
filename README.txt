We created an app that has the basics for being a “social media platform” such as facebook and so on.
The app mainly includes users, the users can send each other friend requests to become friends. As normal human beings the other user can accept or decline to be his friend. 
Once the user has signed into the app he (or she) can share posts. we supported a feature that looks like a “status” from facebook.
Each user has the privilege to like or comment on any post.
The users can communicate with each other via messages. (this feature was not verified 100%)
